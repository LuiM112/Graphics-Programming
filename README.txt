1. What was your favorite topic or project in the course and why? (1pt)
    I enjoyed learning about WebGL as a whole. honestly one of the more interesting part
    compared to ray casting which was just a mess to me overall.

2. If you could improve any aspect of this course, what would it be and why? (1pt)
    If there was a bit more visual demonstrations as like, the whole usage VR to demonstrate how ray casting operates on a pixel
    or using that frog shader browser was a nice demonstration. Something to show me the step by step.

3. If you could go back in time to the first week of class and give yourself advice on how to best navigate this course, what would it be? (1pt)
    When I read something I would think "Oh yeah I got it" but ended up being wrong overall. I wished I've gone back and asked for clarification 
    on whether what I was thinking was the correct answer or not. A second party approval overall because I know I messed up a lot and just caused 
    many errors.
